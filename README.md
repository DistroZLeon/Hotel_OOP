This is a project for the Object Oriented Programming class.

The idea of it is that the program simulates a hotel receptionist who has to schedule all the guests, during the current year, based on their needs and number of available rooms. It has to make the best choices so that in the end, all groups are scheduled at the earliest date.

The hotel has a limited number of each type of room (simple bedroom, apartment, spectacle room, individual room) and restaurant seats.

Every group needs to specify the number of people, followed by their names and preference of eating breakfast in the room or at the hotel's restaurant, the number of days of their staying and the choice of booking any kind of spectacle type room.
